= XlateID.xsl

[abstract]
Adds a language code to *xml:id* attributes and the links that refer to them.

== Parameters

 [noFixupURI]

`noFixupURI` (URI):: the XLink role used to identify links which
should not be fixed up; default http://schema.org/significantLink.

== Input
An XML document. The root element of the document must have an xml:lang
attribute.

== Output
An XML document.

== Description
This stylesheet copies the source document, and adds the language code
specified on the documentâ€™s root element to the end of all xml:id
attributes and all xl:href attributes which contain a fragment
identifier.

If you do not want the language code to be added to an xl:href
attribute, you must add an xl:role attribute to the linking element and
set its value to the URI specified by the `noFixupURI` parameter,
http://schema.org/significantLink by default.

In DocBook files, the language code is also added to all linkend and
endterm attributes and to every value in arearefs attributes. This is
not affected by the xl:role attribute.

In all cases the language code is separated from the value to which it
is added by a full stop.

This stylesheet is meant to be used when combining several translated
documents into a multi-lingual document.
