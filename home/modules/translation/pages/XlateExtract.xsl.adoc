= XlateExtract.xsl

[abstract]
Copies translatable elements from an XML document to a new XLIFF file.

== Parameters

 Source

`Source` (string):: the name of the source document

== Input
An XML document. You must mark up the source document with:

. The xlf:id attributes which uniquely identify each translation
string.

== Output
An http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html[XLIFF]
document.

== Description
The stylesheet examines the source file for translatable elements. (A
translatable element is one which has an xlf:id attribute and does not
have the its:translate='no' attribute.)

For each translatable element, a new translation unit is written to the
output document which contains this translatable element as its source.

For DocBook files, a header is added containing some bibliographical
metadata from the source file â€” db:biblioid class='pubsnumber',
db:edition and db:releaseinfo.

Any inline markup within the translatable element is escaped. This
enables you to examine the inline markup in a translation editor such as
Virtaal.
