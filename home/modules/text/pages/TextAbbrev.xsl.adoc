= TextAbbrev.xsl

[abstract]
Makes sure that abbreviations are punctuated correctly after
transclusion.

== Parameters

 [abbrevClassRef]

`abbrevClassRef` (URI):: a URI that identifies abbreviations. Default
http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abbreviation.

Input
-----

An XML document. Any abbreviations whose punctuation needs checking must
be marked up with ITS 2.0 text analysis attributes as described below.

Output
------

An XML document, identical to the input except that abbreviations are
punctuated correctly.

Description
-----------

The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element. If
any element has the attribute
its:taClassRef='http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abbreviation', the
stylesheet adds punctuation to the element according to the following
algorithm:

1.  If the text within the element already ends with a full stop, the
full stop is stripped off;
2.  If there is a full stop immediately following the element, the
element is written to the output document with no following full stop;
otherwise, the element is written to the output document with a
following full stop.

This means that the abbreviation will be written out with just one
following full stop. If you transclude the abbreviation at the end of
sentence it will _not_ end up with two following full stops.

To use the its:taClassRef attribute you must set its:version='2.0' on
the element or on the containing document.

Roadmap
-------

In DocBook files, this stylesheet matches abbrev elements as well as
elements with the
its:taClassRef='http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abbreviation' attribute.
This may be removed in a future release.
