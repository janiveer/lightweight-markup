= TextNumbers.xsl

[abstract]
Makes sure that numbers are punctuated correctly according to the
document language.

== Parameters

 [numberClassRef]

`numberClassRef` (URI):: a URI that identifies numbers. Default
http://dbpedia.org/ontology/number.

== Input
An XML document. Any numbers which need localisation must be marked up
with ITS 2.0 text analysis attributes as described below.

== Output
An XML document, identical to the input except that numbers are
localised.

== Description
The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element. If
any element has the attribute
its:taClassRef='http://dbpedia.org/ontology/number' and contains just a
plain XML number, i.e. with no grouping separators and a full stop for
the decimal separator, the stylesheet formats the number according to
the language defined by the nearest ancestor xml:lang attribute.

Usually you would rely on translators to localise the format of numbers
in the document. This stylesheet is useful if you want to enforce a
consistent number format for each locale, or if any translation strings
contain just numbers and you donâ€™t want to bother translating them.

The following languages are currently supported: `en-GB`, `en-US`, `fr`,
`de`, `nl`, `es`, `sv`, `nb`, `pt`, `it`, `fi`, `zh` and the special ISO
language codes `und`, `mul`, `mis` and `zxx`. The localisation formats
are taken from
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSS28S_3.0.0/com.ibm.help.forms.doc/locale_spec/i_xfdl_r_locale_quick_reference.html[IBM].

To use the its:taClassRef attribute you must set its:version='2.0' on
the element or on the containing document.

== Roadmap
In DocBook files, this stylesheet matches abbrev elements as well as
elements with the its:taClassRef='http://dbpedia.org/ontology/number'
attribute. This may be removed in a future release.
