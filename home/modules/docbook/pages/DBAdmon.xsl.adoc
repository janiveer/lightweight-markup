[abstract]
Creates automatic titles for admonitions in a DocBook document.

== Parameters
None.

Input
-----

A DocBook document. Any admonitions (important, caution, note, tip or
warning) for which you want an automatic title must have an empty title
element.

Output
------

A DocBook document, identical to the input except that admonitions have
titles in the appropriate language.

Description
-----------

The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element.
When it finds the title element of an admonition, if the title element
is empty, the stylesheet gets the language specified by the nearest
ancestor xml:lang attribute and looks up the correct wording for the
title in the `DataLabels.xml` file.

The relevant title strings in the `DataLabels.xml` file are called
`important`, `caution`, `note`, `tip` and `warning`.

If the admonition is a note or a tip and it contains more than one para
element, the stylesheet uses the `notes` and `tips` strings
respectively.

The following languages are currently supported: `de`, `en`, `fr`, `nl`,
`es`, `sv`, `nb`, `pt`, `it`, `fi` and `zh`.
