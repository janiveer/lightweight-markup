[abstract]
Turns simple inline lists into punctuated lists and adds a final “and”
or “or” in the appropriate language.

== Parameters

None.

== Input
A DocBook document containing simplelist type='inline' elements.

== Output
A DocBook document, identical to the input except that any simplelist
type='inline' elements are replaced with punctuated inline lists with a
final “and” or “or” in the appropriate language.

== Description
The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element.
For each simplelist type='inline' element, the members of the list are
output as a comma separated inline list.

If the role attribute of the simplelist is set to and, the conjunction
“and” is added before the final member of the list in the language
specified by the nearest ancestor xml:lang attribute. Likewise, if the
role attribute of the simplelist is set to or, the conjunction “or” is
added before the final member of the list in the language specified by
the nearest ancestor xml:lang attribute.

This stylesheet has similar functionality to the way simplelist
type='inline' elements are processed by the DocBook XSL stylesheets. The
differences are:

. The final conjunction is specified via the role attribute.
. For languages which require it, the final conjunction is output
within a wrapper element with the ling:type='depend' attribute. This
enables you to use the xref:linguistic:LingDepend.xsl.adoc[LingDepend.xsl] stylesheet
on the output file to select the correct form of the final conjunction,
depending on the phonetic environment.

For example, in Spanish, if the role attribute is set to and, the
xref:linguistic:LingDepend.xsl.adoc[LingDepend.xsl] stylesheet will change the final
conjunction to _e_ if the following word begins with an “i” sound, or
_y_ otherwise. (There must be wrapper elements, e.g. phrase, around each
term in the list, using the ling:pron attribute to indicate the initial
sound of each term.)

The final conjunctions are specified in the `DataLabels.xml` file. The
supported languages are German, English, Spanish, Finnish, French,
Italian, Norwegian Bokmål, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish and Simplified
Chinese.
