= DBImage.xsl

[abstract]
Resolves image file references against all ancestor `xml:base` attributes.

== Parameters

None.

Input
-----

A DocBook document. Chapters or sections which have been transcluded
must have xml:base attributes giving their origin, either absolute or
relative to the complete document.

Output
------

A DocBook document, identical to the input except that any image file
references are resolved against all ancestor xml:base attributes.

Description
-----------

The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element.
For each imagedata element, if there is a fileref attribute, it is
resolved against all ancestor xml:base attributes and written to the
output document.

It is assumed that document modules refer to image files relative to
their own location. You can use this stylesheet to modify image file
references to point to the location of the original image relative to
the assembled documentâ€™s location. The transclusion or assembly process
used to build the document must add xml:base attributes to show the
origin of each document module.
