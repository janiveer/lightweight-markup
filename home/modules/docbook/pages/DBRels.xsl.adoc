[abstract]
Creates automatic links between sections in a document.

== Parameters

 [linkHome] [linkPart] [linkStyle]

`linkHome` (URI):: the XLink role used to identify the start of
automatic links; default http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/item.
`linkPart` (URI):: the XLink role used to identify the targets of
automatic links; default
http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/collection.
`linkStyle` (String):: the style string that determines the content of
the automatic links; default select: title.

Input
-----

A DocBook document. The start locations and sections to be included in
automatic links must be marked up as described below.

Output
------

A DocBook document, identical to the input but with automatic links
between sections of the document.

Description
-----------

To use this stylesheet you must assign a name to each set of related
sections. You mark up the location for a list of automatic links by
adding, in the info section at the start of a chapter or section, an
extendedlink element with the xl:role attribute set to
http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/item.

Within this extendedlink element, add an arc child element whose xl:to
attribute contains the name you have assigned to this set of related
sections. (You can add more than one arc element if you want to create
links to several named sets of related sections.)

It would be good practice for this extendedlink element also to contain
a locator element to point to the chapters or sections which this link
contains, but the stylesheet does not look for a locator. It looks for
matching chapters or section as described below.

In each chapter or section that you want to include in a set of related
sections, you must add an extendedlink element with the xl:role
attribute set to http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/collection.
This must contain an XLink resource element whose xl:label attribute
contains the name you have assigned to this set of related sections.
(You can add more than one XLink resource element if you want to include
this chapter or section in several named sets of related sections.)

The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element. If
any chapter or section of the document is marked as the start of an
automatic link, the stylesheet builds an itemizedlist containing links
to all the chapters or sections which are marked to be included in that
named set of related sections.

The list is positioned after any body text, but before any subsections.
Each link in the list is an xref element; the content is determined by
the xrefstyle attribute, which by default is set to select: title.

Resource Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DocBook 5.0 does not have XLink resource elements. For this purpose,
PACBook provides a custom layer for the DocBook 5.0 chema which adds a
resource element to the extendedlink element. See the
xref:introduction:PACBook-Schema.adoc[PACBook RNG schema]. (In DocBook 5.1 it may be
possible to use a link element with the xl:type='resource' attribute,
but this has not been tested.)

Link Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the itemizedlist of links, the stylesheet creates an introductory
para element in the language determined by the nearest ancestor xml:lang
attribute. By default, this contains the text called links from
`DataLabels.xml`. In English, this is "See the following sections:".
The supported languages are German, English, Spanish, French, Dutch and
Swedish.

It is possible to specify different text for the introductory paragraph
by adding an XLink title element to the extendedlink that marks the
start of the automatic link. This is not possible in DocBook 5.0. The
xref:introduction:PACBook-Schema.adoc[PACBook RNG schema] adds a title element to
extendedlink to enable this. (In DocBook 5.1, you may be able to use a
link xl:type='title' element within the extendedlink, but this has not
been tested.)

NOTE: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6573[RFC 6573] specifies that the item
relation points _from_ the collection _towards_ the item; the collection
relation points _from_ the item _towards_ the collection.
