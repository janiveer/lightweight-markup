= DBGloss.xsl

[abstract]
Builds glossaries automatically and adds XLink titles to glossary terms
in the document.

== Parameters

 [maxRecurseDepth]

*maxRecurseDepth* (Integer):: the maximum number of recursions that
the stylesheet should make when following glosssee and glossseealso
links; default 8.

Input
-----

A DocBook document. Any glossary which is to be build automatically must
be marked up as described below.

Output
------

A DocBook document, identical to the input except the glossary is built
and glossary entries have XLink titles.

Description
-----------

The stylesheet recurses through the document and copies each element. If
any element is a glossary with the role='collection' attribute, the
stylesheet checks every glossentry element to see if it is referenced by
a glossterm element in the document. If it is, the glossentry is written
to the output document.

The functionality of this stylesheet is based on the glossary collection
function in the DocBook XSL stylesheets, with the following differences:

. Glossary entries which are referenced within the glossary via
glosssee and glossseealso elements are included in the built glossary.
. It is assumed that all required glossentry elements are already
included in the glossary. To include an external glossary, use XInclude.

For example:

[source,xml]
....
<glossary role="collection">
    <xi:include href="http://DBK/Topics/Common/modules/gloss_access_full.docbook"
                xpointer="xmlns(db=http://docbook.org/ns/docbook)
                          xpath(//db:glossary/node())"/>
</glossary>
....

When following glosssee and glossseealso elements, there is a risk that
the stylesheet will get trapped in circular references. To avoid this,
the stylesheet will only recurse through 8 glosssee or glossseealso
links. You can change the recursion depth by passing the
`maxRecurseDepth` parameter to the stylesheet.

In addition to this, the stylesheet also adds an xl:title attribute to
every glossterm element in the document. This contains the text of the
referenced glossary definition. As a result, if you use the DocBook XSL
stylesheets to transform the document into a web page, web site or
compiled HTML help file, users will be able see a preview of a glossary
definition by hovering the mouse pointer on the glossary term.

To use this stylesheet, glossentry elements must have an xml:id
attribute and glossterm elements must reference them via their linkend
or xl:href attributes.
